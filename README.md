Capture the Flag Challenges - Algorand Testnet

This repository contains solutions for three Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, all conducted on the Algorand Testnet.

Challenge 1: Where is the Flag?
Task:
You must find a hidden clue within a deployed smart contract. This clue is stored in the contractâ€™s global storage, and it can be uncovered by analyzing one of its transactions.

Challenge 2: Find the Hidden Flag
Task:
Uncover a hidden clue within six strings. The clue is encrypted and requires deciphering using substitution cipher techniques. Once deciphered, the clue reveals an Asset ID.

Challenge 3: Find the Corresponding Letter/Number Using Asset ID
Task:
Use the Asset ID from Challenge 2 to derive a 9-character string from the wallet address found in Challenge 1. Then, use this key to encrypt a given message.
